# ZML

This code builds a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow. It begins by
generating a random dataset, then constructs a Model class to predict outputs based
on inputs and adjustable parameters (weight and bias). The model is trained over a
number of iterations (epochs), adjusting the parameters to minimize loss. Finally,
the modelâ€™s output is visualized overlaid on the original data.
